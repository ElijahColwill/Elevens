1. They both have a board with the same variables for cards yet to be dealed and cards on the board, as well as a similar turn system
and methods to check if the turn is legal. However, there are differences between how many cards are on the board and what is a legal
move (adding up to 10 instead of 11, etc.).

2. The constructor that created the board in the board class takes in the input of the rank, point values, and other variables in order
to build the board with 11's specifications.

3. The differences in the size of the board is covered, but they do not cover the differences in what counts as a move because isLegal is empty.
